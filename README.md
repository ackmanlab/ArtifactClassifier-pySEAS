## Data utilized in the Machine Learning section of our PLoS Computational Biology paper

Metric training datasets were 7 full datasets randomly selelcted out of 12 full datasets.

Metric testing datasets is what we called the novel testing set.  Wherein 5 completely new datasets that did not contribute to the model.

    ./data/training_dataset.tsv
    ./data/testing_dataset.tsv


Metrics generated from the control data are also saved in the data file:

    
    #astrocyte GFP
    aGFP_list = ['190613_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
                 '190613_03-04_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
                 '190329_02-03_600components_ica_metrics.tsv']

    #microglia GFP       
    mGFP_list =['171211_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
                '191111_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
                '191112_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv']

    #black 6 c57, non-transgenic mice
    WT_list = ['190625_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
               '190904_01-02_600components_ica_metrics.tsv',
               '190625_03-04_600components_ica_metrics.tsv']


## Data visualization and machine learning tests

Included are some of the code used to generate a couple figures for the paper.

**Figure4.1_scripts.ipynb/Figure4.2_scripts.ipynb**: This is the core piece of code used to generate Figure 4 and several of the suplemental figures.

1. How we generated the sIC displayed in the paper
2. How we generated the wavelet power to noise ratio
3. Statistics on comparing between GCaMP animals and Control animals
4. Histograms showing distributions of generated metrics  

**Figure6.1_ML feature selection.ipynb/Figure6.2_ML assessment.ipynb**: This is the core piece of code used to generate Figure 6 and suplemental figure.

1. This will also show the code on how we decided important features
2. PCA projections and mapping metric values on PCA space
3. Iteratitive training, while storing accuracy metrics
4. Iteratitive testing on novel data, while storing accuracy metrics
5. Performance/confidence of the model vs how it performed on the novel data

## Generating metrics for the Machine Learning

This code works dircetly off of the files generated by pySEAS.  The code is parrallelized to speed up metric generation.


    python component_metrics.py -h
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i INPUT [INPUT ...], --input INPUT [INPUT ...]
                            path to the ica that needs characterization or tsv file that needs
                            class update
      -f FPS, --fps FPS     frames per second from recordings
      -g GROUP_PATH [GROUP_PATH ...], --group_path GROUP_PATH [GROUP_PATH ...]
                            save path to a file that groups the experiment. If used on experiments
                            that have already been characterized, this will force the re-
                            calculation of any already processed datafile
      -pr PROCESS, --process PROCESS
                            Number of CPU dedicated to processing; 0 will max out the number of
                            CPU
      -uc UPDATECLASS [UPDATECLASS ...], --updateClass UPDATECLASS [UPDATECLASS ...]
                            directory to ica.hdf5, put the tsv path into the input arguemnt,
                            updates the tsv based on ica.hdf5 classification
      -fc, --force          force re-calculation if not grouped


Each script should be run in the terminal. Here are some common commands that will produce metrics.

Be sure to set the FPS to your recording rate (default 10Hz). As it is currently written, frequency information will produce metrics based on the wavelet family Morlet (Ï‰ = 4) described in the paper.

### One file:

    python component_metrics.py -i /path/to/hdf5/files/XXXXXXXXX_ica.hdf5

This base command will generate a metrics file names similar to the input ica file, where the output will be saved to `/path/to/hdf5/files/XXXXXXXXX_ica_metrics.tsv`

### Grouped files:

    python component_metrics.py -i /path/to/hdf5/files/*_ica.hdf5 -g /path/to/save/metrics/in/a/group/GROUP_metrics.tsv 


`*` is a wildcard expansion and will find all files with the `_ica.hdf5` termination.  All these files will be generated and placed into a single group metrics file.  Each index is generated based on the name of the `_ica` file name.  

**If a file is re-run on the same file, the code will overwrite the previous metric generaton.** This is to reduce the ability for dupication of metrics based on a single experiment. Each component has its own unique index saved in the dataframe. Outputs will be saved to `/path/to/save/metrics/in/a/group/GROUP_metrics.tsv`, with an extra column `anml`, which will number each animal independet of eachother.

### updatate class in the tsv file for specific ica.hdf5:


    python component_metrics.py -i /path/to/save/metrics/in/a/group/GROUP_metrics.tsv -uc /path/to/hdf5/files/XXXXXXXXX_ica.hdf5
